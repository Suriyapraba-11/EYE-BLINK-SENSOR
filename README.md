# EYE-BLINK-SENSOR
*(Accident preventing googles)
ABSTRACT:
This project provides the detail information on the project including details of introduction, literature 
survey, methodologies, study cases and future works along with supporting information’s and references 
taken for doing the project.Accidents due to driver drowsiness can be prevented using eye blink sensors. 
The driver is supposed to wear the eye blink sensor frame throughout the course of driving and blink has 
to be for a couple of seconds to detect drowsiness. Any random changes in steering movement leads to 
reduction in wheel speed. The threshold of the vibration sensor can be varied and accordingly action can 
be taken. The outcome is that the vibrator attached to eye blink sensor’s frame vibrates if the driver falls 
asleep.The wheel is slowed or stopped depending on the condition. The proposed system consists of two 
main parts that detect eye blinking based on IR sensors mounted on eyewear. Depending on the reflected 
andabsorbed IR radiation, this system detects and classifies the eye blinking into normal blinking(NB).
